"""Patch `makechrootpkg` for the worker: confinement, and one nspawn default.

Mostly the first. The last patch in the list is unrelated to confinement and
says so; it opts out of a systemd-nspawn default that is about to change.

A PKGBUILD is bash. Sourcing one runs it. `makechrootpkg` does that twice
*outside* the chroot, as the build user:

  1. `download_sources()` runs `makepkg --verifysource`, and makepkg sources the
     PKGBUILD to learn what to fetch;
  2. it runs `source PKGBUILD` directly to read `pkgbase`/`pkgname`.

Unconfined, either one lets a build write every other build's files — another
package's cached sources, the shared GnuPG keyring, a concurrent job's PKGBUILD.
Checksums are no defence: they are declared by the PKGBUILD, so rewriting a
neighbour's PKGBUILD rewrites its checksums too.

Both sites are wrapped in `aurcache-sandbox`, which applies a Landlock policy
allowing writes only to that build's own directories. The chroot build itself is
untouched: Landlock refuses `mount(2)` outright, so nothing confined this way
could run `arch-nspawn`.

Writes a shadowed copy to /usr/local/bin, which precedes /usr/bin in both PATH
and sudo's `secure_path`; the packaged script is left alone.

Every patch MUST apply exactly once. If devtools moves a call site this fails
the image build rather than silently shipping a worker that executes PKGBUILDs
unconfined — the reason a patch is preferred here over shadowing `makepkg` on
PATH, whose failure mode would be invisible.
