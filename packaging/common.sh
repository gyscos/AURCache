# Shared PKGBUILD helpers: how to build this repo's Rust binaries for $CARCH.
#
# Sourced by both PKGBUILDs rather than duplicated, so the two cannot disagree
# about targets, flags or where the output lands.

# The Rust target triple for the architecture makepkg is building for.
#
# Arch has no cross-compilation feature -- no `--target`, nothing in devtools --
# but `CARCH` is a plain shell variable makepkg sources and uses for the package
# name, so setting it and cross-compiling inside build() produces a correctly
# labelled package. That is a convention, not a supported mode, which is why it
# is written down here rather than assumed.
# Whether $CARCH is the machine we are running on.
#
# Not a plain string compare: Arch calls 32-bit ARM `armv7h` while `uname -m`
# says `armv7l`, so a native armv7 build would otherwise look like a cross one
# and demand a cross toolchain that a native host has no reason to install.
