# End-to-end test for the hybrid image's legacy container builder.
#
# Covers the upgrade path of a pre-worker deployment that used "host build
# mode": Docker socket mounted, BUILD_ARTIFACT_DIR set, container not
# privileged. That combination selects the legacy builder, which spawns a
# container per package instead of building in a chroot.
#
# Usage: scripts/test-e2e-hybrid-legacy.sh [package] [port] [timeout]
