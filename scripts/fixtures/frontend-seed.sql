-- one pass at boot before it sleeps, and at that point this table is empty, so
-- it has nothing to rewrite. The script sets a long VERSION_CHECK_INTERVAL so
-- the next pass never lands inside the run.
--
-- The package list deliberately covers every status badge and the awkward
-- names: `2048.c` and `python-3.11` look like filenames, `aewm++` contains the
-- character that is literal in a path but a space in a query value.
