# End-to-end test for build credentials reaching the chroot.
#
# A package whose sources sit behind SSH is the motivating case for worker
# package-affinity (`unreal-engine`), and the credential path has one step no
# unit test can cover: whether the key staged for a job is readable by the
# unprivileged user makepkg runs as inside makechrootpkg. That depends on
# devtools' uid mapping, so it needs a real chroot and a real authenticated
# fetch.
#
# Everything here is ephemeral — a keypair generated per run, a throwaway git
# server that authorises it — so this runs in CI wherever Docker does, with no
# secret committed or configured.
#
# Two phases, in order:
#   1. unauthorised — the worker falls back to its own generated key, which the
#      server does not authorise. The build MUST fail. Without this the whole
#      test could pass for the wrong reason (sources cached, fetch skipped, an
#      agent key picked up).
#   2. authorised — the worker is pointed at the key the server accepts. The
#      build must succeed AND the payload's marker must appear in the installed
#      package, proving the fetch really happened.
