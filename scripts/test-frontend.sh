# Renders the Rust frontend in a real browser and asserts each route mounts.

# The unit and SSR tests render components directly, so they cannot see whether
# the page actually boots. Every defect of that kind this frontend has had was
# found by opening it: a blank page, a status badge with no background, a table
# that clipped its last column. This is that pass, scripted.
#
# The check is "did the app mount and render this screen", not a pixel
# comparison. Screenshots are captured with --shots for a human to look at;
# they are not asserted on.

# Usage:
#   scripts/test-frontend.sh                # smoke check, no network needed
#   scripts/test-frontend.sh --shots out/   # also write screenshots there
#   scripts/test-frontend.sh --online       # include routes that fetch from the AUR
