# Managing workers

The **Workers** page lists every worker that has ever enrolled, with its status,
architectures, reserved packages, priority, build strategy and version.

## Build strategies

The **Type** column says how each worker builds:

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chroot` | The `devtools` chroot worker — the supported strategy. |
| `docker` | The legacy container builder, **deprecated**. Shown highlighted. |
| `—` | The worker enrolled before workers reported this; restarting it fills it in. |

A worker reports whatever it calls itself, so a future build strategy appears
here without the server needing to know about it in advance.

This is the quickest way to answer "is anything still on the legacy builder?"
before retiring it — it builds in a reused container image rather than a clean
chroot, and supports neither build caches nor build credentials.

## Approving

A newly enrolled worker is `pending` and cannot build until approved. Approve it
from the Workers page, or let one of the non-interactive paths do it: a shared
enrollment volume (`AURCACHE_ENROLLMENT_DIR`, used by the bundled compose
setup), a pre-approved fingerprint list, or a shared token
(`AURCACHE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`).

Auto-approval only ever applies to a worker that has never been approved. It
will not re-approve one you revoked — an explicit decision outranks a
convenience setting.

## Stopping a worker's intake

To reboot, upgrade or retire a machine without cutting a build short, **stop
its intake** first — the **Stop intake** button on the Workers list or on the
worker's page, or:

```bash
aurcache-cli worker pause 3
```

The worker is given no new builds from its next claim on; they go to other
workers instead, and the ones it is running carry on and finish normally. It
stays approved and keeps checking in, so its page shows how many builds are
still running there and says when it is empty. Nothing is sent to the worker
and nothing changes on the machine: the server simply stops offering it jobs.
A lower-priority worker that would have waited for it stops waiting straight
away.

When the machine is ready again, **Resume intake** (`aurcache-cli worker resume
3`) and it takes new builds from its next claim. A stopped intake survives the
worker restarting, so it will not start building the moment it comes back up.

Stopping intake does not change which jobs are its to take. A package reserved
to it through `WORKER_PACKAGES`, or an architecture only it builds natively,
waits for it rather than going elsewhere, and the Builds page says so. To hand
that work to others for good, revoke the worker instead.

## Retiring a worker

**Revoke it.** Revoking refuses the worker's certificate from that moment,
releases any packages it had reserved through `WORKER_PACKAGES`, and requeues
whatever it was building so another worker picks the job up.

Stop its intake first if it is building something you want to keep: revoking
takes its builds back and requeues them from the start. Revoking also resumes
intake, so a machine approved again later builds straight away.

There is no delete. Worker rows are kept so a build from two years ago still
shows which machine produced it, with what architectures and what version.
Revoked workers move behind a **Show retired** toggle so the list stays useful.

A retired machine that comes back re-enrolls and appears as revoked with a
recent "last seen", which is the signal to approve it again if you want it back.
Its certificate is still on file, so that is one click.

## How much memory did a build need?

The Builds list has a **Peak RAM** column: the high-water mark of the build's
whole process tree — `makechrootpkg`, `systemd-nspawn`, `makepkg`, and one
compiler per core, measured together.

It is most useful on a build that failed with exit 137, which is an OOM kill and
says nothing else about itself. Knowing the last successful build of the same
package peaked at 6 GiB turns that into a number you can act on.

The figure is exact, not sampled: each build runs in a cgroup of its own and
this is that cgroup's `memory.peak`, so it covers every process in the tree with
no polling and no blind spot.

**A dash means not reported**, not zero. That happens when:

- the worker predates this, or is the deprecated container builder — Docker
  exposes no peak figure on cgroup v2, where `max_usage` no longer exists;
- the worker could not prepare a cgroup subtree. A container needs
  `privileged`, which `mkarchroot` and `arch-nspawn` already require, so the
  published images qualify. A native install needs `Delegate=yes` on the unit,
  which `aurcache-worker.service` sets; systemd otherwise owns that subtree.
- the kernel is older than 5.19, which is where `memory.peak` arrived.

Builds run either way — this measures the work, it does not do it.

## Why is a build not starting?

`aurcache-cli doctor` answers this directly. It walks the chain — server, token,
fleet, queue — and names the first thing that is actually wrong, with the
command that fixes it:

```
$ aurcache-cli doctor
✓ server   reachable at http://localhost:8080/api
✓ token    authenticated as you
✗ workers  1 worker(s) enrolled, none approved
           → aurcache-cli worker approve 3
✓ queue    nothing queued
```

It tells the three fleet failures apart, because they are three different
mistakes: nothing enrolled, enrolled but never approved, and approved but not
calling in. The queue check reports the same reasons the Builds page shows,
[described below](#what-the-builds-page-is-telling-you).

`doctor` exits non-zero if any check fails, so it doubles as a health gate in a
script, and `--format json` gives the checks as structured output.

`aurcache-cli builds watch` follows the queue and explains what it sees:

```
$ aurcache-cli builds watch
[   0s] turso #3: waiting-for-deps
[   0s] libaegis #1: active
[  47s] libaegis #1: successful
[  95s] simsimd #2: successful
[  96s] turso #3: active
```

It reports changes rather than repeating the current state, prints a heartbeat
while work is in flight, and **fails fast on a stall**: if nothing has changed
for a while and nothing is building, the queue cannot advance on its own, so it
says so instead of waiting out the timeout.

`--package NAME` narrows it to one package; `--timeout` and `--stall-after`
adjust the limits.

**It follows what it watched.** Builds that had already finished when it started
are history — it says how many it is not following, and how many of those
failed, but they do not affect the exit code. A build it never saw run is not
one it can report on, and on a server that has been up for a while almost every
build in the list is of that kind.

### Waiting for builds you just triggered

Do not follow a trigger with a separate `builds watch`: the two are separate
processes, and a build can be queued, run and fail in the gap between them. From
the watcher's first listing that build is indistinguishable from any other
finished build, so the failure is silently skipped.

Use `--wait` on the command that does the triggering:

```
$ aurcache-cli pkg add turso --wait
queued 3 build(s) across 3 package(s)
[   0s] libaegis/1: active
[  47s] libaegis/1: successful
[  96s] turso/3: active
[ 140s] turso/3: successful
3 build(s) succeeded in 140s
```

One process can list the builds *before* it fires the request, so everything
that appears afterwards is that trigger's work — including a build that failed
before the request returned, and including the dependency builds that are queued
later as the graph fans out. It exits non-zero if any of them fails.

`pkg add`, `pkg update` and `builds retry` all take it, with
`--wait-timeout`, `--wait-stall-after` and `--fail-on-requeue`. Under
`--format json` the progress lines go to stderr so stdout stays a single
document.

A build that was already running before the trigger is **not** included: `--wait`
answers for what it queued, not for the queue as a whole. `builds watch` is
still the tool for that.

If a script already knows a build reference — `pkg update` and `builds retry`
both print what they queued — `builds watch --build hello/3` follows it by name
whatever state it has reached.

## What the Builds page is telling you

An enqueued build that no worker can claim is flagged with the reason:

| Reason | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Reserved for *worker* (offline) | Package affinity ties it to a worker that is not online | Start that worker, or revoke it to release the reservation |
| No worker builds *arch* | No approved worker handles that architecture | Enroll one, or remove the architecture from the package |
| All capable workers are offline | Workers exist for the job but none is online | Start one |
| Intake is stopped on every capable worker (*workers*) | The workers that could take it are online but were asked to take nothing new | Resume intake on one of them when it is ready |

A build without a reason is simply queued behind other work — that is normal and
needs nothing.

## Builds that never finish

A worker sends a heartbeat every `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` seconds. If one
stops, its builds are requeued after `LEASE_TTL` and retried, up to
`MAX_ATTEMPTS` times before being failed for good. A build that runs
implausibly long is reclaimed the same way even if its worker is still
heartbeating, which covers a hung build on a healthy machine.

If a build is genuinely just slow, raise `WORKER_BUILD_TIMEOUT` on the worker —
the default kills a build after three hours.
