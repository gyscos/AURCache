# Build credentials

Some packages fetch their sources from somewhere that requires authentication.
The AUR's `unreal-engine`, for example, clones
`git+ssh://git@github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine`, which only works for a GitHub
account that has joined the Epic Games organisation.

Every worker therefore has an SSH key available to `makepkg` when it downloads
sources.

## The default: a key per worker

On first start a worker generates an ed25519 keypair and logs the public half:

```
INFO Build SSH key: /var/lib/aurcache-worker/ssh/id_ed25519
    Add this public key to the account that may fetch restricted sources:
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAA... aurcache-worker
```

Onboarding is then:

1. Start the worker and approve it on the Workers page.
2. Copy the public key from its log.
3. Add it to the GitHub account (**Settings → SSH and GPG keys**) that has
   access to the sources.
4. Set `WORKER_PACKAGES` for the packages that need it, so those builds are
   routed to this machine. See [Routing](./routing.md).

This suits GitHub: a public key may be attached to only one account, but an
account can hold many keys. One key per worker is the shape GitHub expects, and
no private key is ever copied between machines — retiring a worker is deleting
one public key, not rotating a shared secret everywhere.

:::warning
`WORKER_DATA_DIR` must be a persisted volume. The generated key lives there, and
if the directory is lost the worker generates a new key that the remote will
reject — with no obvious sign of why.
:::

## Supplying your own key

When the credential is issued centrally, or you want deployment to need no
follow-up action, point the worker at a key:

```yaml
services:
  worker:
    environment:
      WORKER_GIT_SSH_KEY: /run/secrets/build_key
      WORKER_PACKAGES: unreal-engine
    secrets:
      - build_key

secrets:
  build_key:
    file: ./secrets/id_ed25519
```

A plain read-only mount works equally well:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./secrets/build-ssh:/etc/aurcache-worker/ssh:ro
    environment:
      WORKER_GIT_SSH_KEY: /etc/aurcache-worker/ssh/id_ed25519
```

When this is set, **no key is generated** — two keys on one machine would make
"which one is in use?" ambiguous exactly when you are debugging an
authentication failure. If the file is missing the worker says so plainly rather
than quietly falling back to a generated key.

Do **not** pass the key through an environment variable. It would be visible in
`docker inspect` and `/proc/<pid>/environ`, and would end up in the compose file
you commit. A mount is both safer and less trouble.

Ownership and permissions do not matter: the worker copies the key to a private
location with the right mode before each build, so a root-owned `0400` Docker
secret is fine.

## Host keys

With no `known_hosts` configured, the worker accepts a host key the first time
it sees one and rejects it if it later changes. To pin known hosts instead:

```sh
ssh-keyscan github.com > known_hosts
```

```yaml
    environment:
      WORKER_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS: /etc/aurcache-worker/ssh/known_hosts
```

## The key is not visible to the package

`makepkg` downloads sources **before** the build chroot is entered, so the
credential is only ever available on the worker itself. It is never mounted into
the chroot, where `prepare()`, `build()` and `package()` run — those are
arbitrary scripts from a PKGBUILD, and anything they can reach they can send
somewhere else.

Two consequences:

- Ordinary git operations inside a build work normally, they simply have no
  access to the key.
- A PKGBUILD that fetches from an authenticated remote inside `build()` rather
  than declaring it in `source=()` will fail. Declared sources are the supported
  path — they are what gets checksummed, and what gets fetched before any
  package code runs.

## Other credentials

For credentials that are not SSH — a `.netrc`, an API token, a licence file —
`WORKER_BIND_MOUNTS` exposes extra paths to the build:

```sh
WORKER_BIND_MOUNTS=/etc/aurcache-worker/licence:/opt/licence
```

Unlike the SSH key these **are** mounted into the chroot and are therefore
readable by package code. Use them only for credentials you are willing to
expose to the packages you build.
