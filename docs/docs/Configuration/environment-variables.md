# Environment Variables
AURCache can be configured using the following environment variables:

## Settings precedence

Most settings can also be set in the UI — globally on the Settings page or
per-package on the package's Settings page. When the same setting is
configured in multiple places, the resolution order is, from highest to
lowest priority:

1. **Per-package setting** — explicit user intent for one package always
   wins. This lets you override an env-imposed baseline for a single
   package (e.g. give one heavy build more memory) without touching the
   deployment defaults.
2. **Environment variable** — the admin's deploy-time override of the
   global default. Locks the global Settings page tile, but does **not**
   prevent per-package overrides.
3. **Global setting** — UI-set baseline stored in the database.
4. **Static default** — built-in fallback (the "Default" column below).

The UI badges reflect the source: `(default)`, `(inherited)` (= global),
`(inherited from env)`, or no badge when this scope owns the value.

## Database Configuration
| Variable               | Type                  | Description                                                         | Default                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| DB_TYPE                | (POSTGRESQL\| SQLITE) | Type of Database (SQLite, PostgreSQL)                               | SQLITE                    |
| DB_USER                | String                | POSTGRES Username  (ignored if sqlite)                              | null                      |

| DB_NAME                | String                | Database name                                                       | 'db.sqlite' or 'postgres' |

## General Settings

| Variable               | Type          | Description                                                           | Default |
|------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| VERSION_CHECK_INTERVAL | Duration      | How often to check package versions (`1h`, `30m`, or seconds)         | `1h`    |
| AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE   | String (crontab) | When to rebuild out-of-date packages, as a [schedule](#schedules) (empty to disable) | empty   |
| TZ                     | String        | Timezone cron schedules (`AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE`, `MIRROR_RANK_SCHEDULE`) are read in, e.g. `Europe/Paris`. The compose files forward the host's `/etc/localtime` and pass `TZ` through when it is set where compose runs | the host's, else UTC |
| LOG_LEVEL              | String        | Log level                                                             | INFO    |
| JOB_TIMEOUT            | Duration      | Longest a build may run before the server reclaims it (`3h`, seconds) | `1h`    |
| MAX_ARTIFACT_SIZE      | Size          | Largest package file a worker may upload, e.g. `20G`; also a setting, per package or global | `20G` |
| RETIRED_PACKAGE_GRACE  | Duration      | How long a package file stays downloadable after a newer build or a removal takes it out of the repository database (`1d`, `12h`, or seconds), so clients that synced just before can still fetch it | `1d` |
| ACTIVITY_RETENTION     | Duration      | How long an entry stays in the **Logs** page (`90d`, `4w`, or seconds). `0` keeps everything | `90d` |
| PARSE_NETWORK          | Boolean       | Let a PKGBUILD reach the network while the server parses it; also a setting, global | false |
| SECRET_KEY             | String        | \>32Byte Random String for singing cookies                            | Random  |
| AURCACHE_PUBLIC_URL    | String        | Base URL workers use for the pacman repo, baked into build configs. Example: `http://aurcache:8081` | `http://localhost:8081` |

Builds run on [build workers](../workers/split-chroot.md), which are configured
on the worker itself rather than here — including how many builds it runs at
once and how long it will let one run.

:::note Legacy build settings
`BUILDER_IMAGE`, `CPU_LIMIT`, `MEMORY_LIMIT` and `BUILD_ARTIFACT_DIR`
configured the per-build Docker container that AURCache used to spawn. In the
split setup they do nothing on the server: a worker limits its own builds with
[`WORKER_BUILD_MEMORY_MAX`, `WORKER_BUILD_CPUS` and their `WORKER_TOTAL_BUILD_*` totals](../workers/split-chroot.md#resource-limits),
and uploads packages over the API rather than through a shared directory.

They are still read by the [hybrid compatibility
image](../workers/hybrid.md), where they
keep their original meanings — `BUILD_ARTIFACT_DIR` is in fact what selects
host build mode there, as it always did.

`MAX_CONCURRENT_BUILDS` is replaced by `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` on each worker (the
hybrid image still reads it, as its embedded worker's default), and
`AURCACHE_REPO_URL` by `AURCACHE_PUBLIC_URL`.

## Build workers

Workers connect to a dedicated mTLS listener and are configured through their
own environment. See [Build Workers](../workers/index.md).

| Variable                | Type    | Description                                                  | Default |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| AURCACHE_WORKER_PORT    | Integer | Port for the worker protocol listener                        | 8083    |
| AURCACHE_TLS_SANS       | String  | Hostnames the worker listener's certificate is valid for     | localhost |
| WORKER_SPILL_DELAY      | Duration | How long before worker priority stops holding a job back      | `60s`      |
| WORKER_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT | Duration | How long before a quiet worker stops counting as available    | `60s`      |
| MAX_ATTEMPTS            | Integer | Requeues before a build is failed for good                   | 3       |

## Schedules

`AUTO_UPDATE_SCHEDULE` and `MIRROR_RANK_SCHEDULE` are written as in crontab:
five fields, `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`, read in the server's
timezone (`TZ`). Each field is `*`, a number, a range `1-5`, a step `*/15`, or
a list `1,15`; months and weekdays take names (`jan`, `mon`), and Sunday is 0
or 7. When both day fields are restricted, a day matching either one runs.

`H` stands for a value picked by a hash of the server and the job, so that
servers -- and the AUR and the mirrors they all reach -- are not hit at the
top of the same hour. It is the same value every time:

| Schedule      | Runs                                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `H 3 * * *`   | every day, at a fixed minute past 3                   |
| `H H(1-5) * * *` | every day, at a fixed time between 01:00 and 05:59 |
| `H/15 * * * *`| every 15 minutes, from a fixed offset                 |
| `0 3 * * 1-5` | at 03:00 sharp on weekdays                            |
| `@daily`      | `H H * * *`; also `@hourly` (`H * * * *`), `@midnight` (`H H(0-2) * * *`), `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@yearly` |

The settings page shows the next runs as a schedule is typed.

Schedules used to be written with a leading seconds field and Sunday as 1
(`0 0 2 * * 1`). A stored schedule is rewritten on upgrade; one set in the
environment is refused, and the activity log gives the same schedule in the
new form.
