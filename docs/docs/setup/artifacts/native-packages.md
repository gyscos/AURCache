# Native packages

AURCache ships as AUR packages — they live in the AUR, not the official
repositories, so install them with an AUR helper (`paru`, `yay`, …):

```bash
paru -S aurcache-server   # the build server and web UI
paru -S aurcache-worker   # a build machine
```

They are separate because their dependencies are: the server needs no
`devtools`, `base-devel` or `sudo`, and most build machines do not want a
server. Both may be installed together on one host; they share the `aurcache`
user.

## Building the packages yourself

```bash
git submodule update --init   # the packaging/ dirs are submodules of the AUR repos
cd packaging/aurcache-server && makepkg -si
cd ../aurcache-worker      && makepkg -si
```

Two PKGBUILDs rather than one split package: the roles share almost no
dependencies, and `makepkg` cannot build one half of a split — which the
container images need, since a worker image has no reason to carry the server.

`makepkg -si` installs the build dependencies itself. One of them — the
server's `wasm-bindgen` — has a version coupling to watch: it must match the
`wasm-bindgen` crate in `frontend-rs/Cargo.lock`, and wasm-bindgen refuses a
mismatched pair rather than producing a subtly broken bundle. The official
package tracks the lock today; if extra ever moves ahead of it, the server
build breaks until they agree again. The worker has no such dependency; it does
not carry the web UI.

Both PKGBUILDs set `options=(!lto)`. makepkg's LTO adds `-flto=auto` to
`CFLAGS`, and the `cc` crate hands that to the vendored C in `aws-lc-sys` and
`ring`; their static archives then hold GCC LTO bytecode, which `ld.lld` — the
linker rustc drives — cannot read. The build fails at link with undefined
`aws_lc_*` symbols and no error from the build script, which is an unpleasant
thing to diagnose from scratch. Rust's own LTO is cargo's business and is
unaffected.

### Cross-compiling

Arch has no cross-compilation mode — no `--target`, and nothing in `devtools` —
but `CARCH` is a plain shell variable `makepkg` uses to label the package, so
exporting it and cross-compiling inside `build()` produces a correctly labelled
result:

```bash
pacman -S aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
cd packaging/aurcache-worker
CARCH=aarch64 makepkg --nodeps --nocheck
```

`--nodeps` because dependency resolution would consult the *host's*
repositories, and `--nocheck` because the tests cannot run binaries built for
another architecture. This is what the container images do.

Only `x86_64` and `aarch64` are supported. The aarch64 toolchain is in `extra`;
armv7's is not packaged officially, and Arch Linux ARM ships no x86_64 cross
toolchain at all — so the images must be built on an x86_64 host.
