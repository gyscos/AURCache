//! Builds the web frontend and puts it where `RustEmbed` will find it.
//!
//! `#[derive(RustEmbed)] #[folder = "web"]` bakes the bundle in at compile
//! time, so a stale `web/` means a server quietly serving an old UI. Doing it
//! from here rather than from a script means the dependency is expressed rather
//! than remembered: the `rerun-if-changed` lines below make cargo rebuild the
//! server whenever the frontend changes, and nobody has to notice.
//!
//! **This does nothing unless the `static` feature is on.** A build script
//! cannot be feature-gated away — it always runs — so it checks the feature
//! itself and returns. Building the server without `static` therefore costs
//! nothing here and needs no wasm toolchain, which is what someone working only
//! on the backend gets.
//!
//! The check reads `CARGO_FEATURE_STATIC` rather than `cfg!(feature = "static")`.
//! Both work today — the `cfg!` was measured, not assumed — but only the
//! environment variable is specified: the Cargo reference lists
//! `CARGO_FEATURE_<name>` as how features reach a build script and says nothing
//! about `cfg!`. The same page warns that `cfg!` in a build script describes the
//! *host* it runs on rather than the target being built, which is why
//! `target_os` and friends must be read from `CARGO_CFG_*`. Features happen not
//! to trip over that; target cfgs do, and this project cross-compiles for
//! arm64. Reading them all the same way keeps that trap shut.
//!
//! The nested cargo invocation is safe because `frontend-rs` is its own
//! workspace with its own target directory: the two builds never contend for
//! the same lock. The cargo-set environment is cleared for the child all the
//! same, since inheriting `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` would undo exactly that.
