//! The settings the `devtools` chroot executor declares, beside the protocol
//! ones every worker has.
//!
//! Split this way because it is the split that matters: the container executor
//! reads `CPU_LIMIT` in milli-CPUs and `MEMORY_LIMIT` in MB and would declare
//! exactly those, with its own descriptions, rather than having a shared
//! vocabulary translated onto it. The server learns what a worker accepts from
//! the worker.
//!
//! Only policy and tuning is here. What a build may *reach* -- the chroot
//! directory, the bind mounts, the build user, the `makechrootpkg` wrapper --
//! is not declared, because a worker runs devtools as root and the set of keys
//! the server may name is the boundary that keeps a compromised server from
//! choosing what runs where. See `design/implemented/worker-configuration.md`.
