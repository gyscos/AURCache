//! What a build's `git+` sources were actually at, read from this worker's own
//! `SRCDEST` mirrors.
//!
//! The server records a commit when it *queues* a build, resolved from the
//! remote; by the time the build runs, upstream may have moved. This is the
//! same question answered from the copy the build was made from, so the record
//! stops being a good guess and becomes what happened.
//!
//! Read from the mirror rather than from the working copy because the working
//! copy dies with the chroot: `makechrootpkg -T` deletes the copy, and
//! `$srcdir` is inside it unless the package happens to keep a persistent build
//! tree. The mirror is this worker's, always present, and holds exactly what
//! makepkg fetched and then cloned the working copy from.
//!
//! Called while the job still holds its `SRCDEST` guard
//! (`crate::srcdest_lock`), so no sibling build can fetch into the mirror
//! between the build ending and this read.
