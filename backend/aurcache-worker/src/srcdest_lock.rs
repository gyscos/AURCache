//! Exclusive use of a pkgbase's `SRCDEST`, and the record of who is using one.
//!
//! One question, asked from two directions. The cache garbage-collector asks
//! "is anyone using this source cache?" so it never evicts a live one; a job
//! about to build asks "may I use it?", because `SRCDEST` is keyed by pkgbase
//! and *not* by platform -- downloads are architecture-independent, so an
//! x86_64 and an aarch64 build of one package share a single directory. Two
//! makepkg runs fetching that git mirror to different commits at once is a
//! race the mirror cannot survive: one build checks out what the other fetched.
//!
//! A guard answers both. Holding one grants the exclusive use *and* keeps the
//! pkgbase in the in-use set, so the two can never disagree -- which is what a
//! plain `HashSet` got wrong: two concurrent builds of one pkgbase collapsed to
//! a single entry, and the first to finish removed it, leaving the second's
//! source cache evictable while it was still building.
//!
//! **At most one holder per pkgbase, and an entry outlives its holder only
//! while someone is queued for it.** So the map is not counting users -- it
//! cannot have more than one -- it is keeping the waiters' rendezvous alive:
//! removing an entry someone is queued on would mint a fresh lock for the next
//! caller and hand out the same directory twice.
//!
//! The key is the pkgbase because `SRCDEST` is (`Cache::srcdest`); two packages
//! sharing an upstream URL keep separate mirrors and cannot collide. Pooling
//! the mirrors by URL would move the key to the source and make a build take
//! several of these at once, in a fixed order -- see
//! `design/remote-workers.md`.
//!
//! What makes the exclusion necessary is the *plain* sources, not the git ones:
//! a tarball is fetched as `<file>.part` and renamed, keyed by filename, so two
//! builds of one package -- different platforms of it -- race on that name. Git
//! would be fine concurrently, since a fetch only adds objects and moves refs
//! atomically.
