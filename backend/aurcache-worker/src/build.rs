//! artifact discovery and exit classification are executor-independent and

/// No `systemd-run` wrapper: the worker places the build in a cgroup of its own
/// (see `crate::cgroup`), which is where its limits are set, its memory is
/// measured and a timeout or a Stop kills it.
///
/// `makechrootpkg` copies the built packages into its **current working
/// directory**, so the caller sets `cwd` to the desired destination (there is
/// no `--pkgdest` flag on `makepkg`). Any `build_flags` are forwarded to
/// `makepkg` after the `--` separator.
///
/// Builds run as `build_user`, which must not be the user the worker itself
/// runs as: file ownership is what keeps the worker's identity and credentials
/// out of reach of the code a PKGBUILD executes.
///
/// `binds` become `-d src:dest` arguments. devtools appends these *after* its
/// own binds, so a bind here overrides one devtools made for the same target —
/// which is how the per-job pacman cache replaces the shared one. There is no
/// supported flag for that; `SRCDEST`, which does have one, uses it instead.
/// Where to find the sandbox-wrapping `makechrootpkg`.
///
/// An absolute path, not a name on `PATH`. The worker runs devtools through
/// `sudo`, and sudo replaces `PATH` with its own `secure_path`, so a `PATH`
/// set for the service never reaches the command. Naming the file is the only
/// way to be sure which one runs.
///
/// This is *not* the packaged `/usr/bin/makechrootpkg`: it is a copy with the
/// two places a PKGBUILD is executed outside the chroot wrapped in
/// `aurcache-sandbox` (see `packaging/patch-makechrootpkg.py`). Running the
/// unpatched one would build packages with those two steps unconfined, which is
/// a silent loss of isolation rather than a failure -- so the default points at
/// the patched copy and an operator who moves it says where it went.
