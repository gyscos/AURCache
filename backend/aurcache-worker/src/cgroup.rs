//! A cgroup per build: its peak memory, its limits, and how it is killed.
//!
//! cgroup v2 records `memory.peak` for a cgroup and everything in it, so giving
//! each build its own answers "how much did this build need" exactly, with no
//! sampling and nothing to poll. The build is a tree -- `makechrootpkg` runs
//! `systemd-nspawn` runs `makepkg` runs one compiler per core -- and every
//! descendant inherits the cgroup its parent was placed in, so one number
//! covers all of them. The same property makes it the place for the build's
//! `memory.max`/`cpu.max` ([`BuildLimits`]) and for `cgroup.kill`.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! <the worker's cgroup>/        e.g. system.slice/aurcache-worker.service
//! ├── worker/                   the worker process itself
//! └── builds/                   every build together: the total limits
//!     ├── build-1010/           one build: its own limits
//!     └── build-1011/
//! ```
//!
//! cgroup limits nest: `builds/`'s `memory.max` caps the sum of the builds
//! under it, and each build's own `memory.max` still applies to that build.
//! Putting the total on `builds/` rather than on the worker's cgroup keeps the
//! worker process out of it, so reaching the total can only ever kill a build,
//! and it tells the two limits apart afterwards (see [`OomCause`]).
//!
//! ## Why the worker has to prepare its own hierarchy
//!
//! cgroup v2 refuses to enable a controller in `cgroup.subtree_control` while
//! processes sit directly in that cgroup (`EBUSY`), and both deployments hand
//! the worker a cgroup it is already running in. So at startup the worker moves
//! itself into a leaf and enables `memory` for its siblings -- the standard
//! delegation dance, and what systemd's own documentation tells a delegated
//! service to do.
//!
//! Both supported deployments can do this:
//!
//!  * **The container images** run privileged, which `mkarchroot` and
//!    `arch-nspawn` already require, and that makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable.
//!  * **A native install** runs under `aurcache-worker.service`, which sets
//!    `Delegate=yes` so systemd hands the subtree over rather than managing it.
//!
//! Where the hierarchy cannot be prepared, builds still run and simply report
//! no figure; nothing here is on the path that produces packages.
