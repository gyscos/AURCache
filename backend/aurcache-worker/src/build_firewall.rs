//! Keep package builds off the worker-protocol port.
//!
//! Builds share the worker host's network namespace (systemd-nspawn runs
//! without `--network-*` flags), so a crafted PKGBUILD can reach the server's
//! worker port: it learns the address from its own `pacman.conf`, fetches the
//! public CA, and submits a rogue registration under a spoofed name. That
//! lands `pending`, one mistaken approval from a valid mTLS certificate.
//!
//! The repo, the AUR and the internet must stay reachable, so the block is by
//! (`uid`, `port`) rather than by host: every build runs as the unprivileged
//! build user (`WORKER_BUILD_USER`, `builder` by default), while the worker
//! itself runs as `aurcache`. One `OUTPUT` rule per address family rejects the
//! build user's TCP traffic to the port the worker actually dials, and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! That port is not always the worker's own: a server reached as
//! `https://aurcache.example.com` (TLS passthrough on 443) shares its port with
//! the whole web, and possibly with the repository. Then the rule is narrowed
//! to the addresses the server's host resolves to, and when the repository is
//! served on one of those same addresses and ports no rule is installed at
//! all, since blocking the worker protocol would block the repository with it.
//!
//! Set `WORKER_BUILD_FIREWALL=0` to skip this (exotic network setups); the
//! worker logs a warning either way when the rule cannot be installed, and
//! never refuses to start over it.
