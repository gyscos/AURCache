//! Where a build gets its chroot, and how it gives it back.
//!
//! Every chroot lives in the worker's storage pool (`aurcache-chroot`): a
//! btrfs filesystem with simple quotas, backed by an image, a device or a
//! dedicated mount. The base chroot is a subvolume there, and a build's chroot
//! is a snapshot of it, taken by the worker before `makechrootpkg` runs, with
//! a second subvolume beside it for the build's workdir. Both sit in one quota
//! group limited to `WORKER_BUILD_DISK_MAX`, under the pool's total
//! (`WORKER_DISK_MAX`), so a build that sets out to fill the disk fails its own
//! build instead. See `design/implemented/build-disk-quota.md`.
//!
//! A snapshot is point-in-time, so the base is refreshed as a new snapshot,
//! swapped in: builds snapshot whatever `root` is at the instant they ask,
//! before or after the swap, and a refresh in flight never holds one up. The
//! overlay chroots, update layers and flattening this replaced existed because
//! an overlay's lower layer must not change for as long as a build reads it.
