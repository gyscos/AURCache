//! The build credential's ssh-agent.
//!
//! A build needs to *use* the worker's SSH key -- some PKGBUILDs fetch from
//! private repositories -- while never being able to read it. The key belongs
//! to the worker's user; builds run as a different, unprivileged one. An agent
//! is what bridges that: it holds the key and hands out signatures over a
//! socket, so a build authenticates without the key material ever being within
//! its reach.
//!
//! The agent runs *as the build user*. That is not a matter of taste --
//! OpenSSH's `ssh-agent` checks the peer uid on every connection and refuses
//! every one that is not its own, so an agent belonging to the worker cannot be
//! used by a build however the socket is owned or moded.
//!
//! Started here, by the worker, rather than by a shell script in the container
//! entrypoints. That was the arrangement before, and it meant the native
//! package had no agent at all -- the script lived under `docker/` and was
//! never packaged, so a natively installed worker could not fetch an
//! authenticated source however it was configured. It also had to run *before*
//! the worker, which is before the key it wanted to load necessarily existed,
//! so a fresh deployment silently started without one and needed a restart to
//! pick it up. Starting it here removes both: one mechanism, after the key is
//! ensured, on every platform.
//!
//! ## What a build can and cannot do with it
//!
//! It can ask the agent to authenticate, for anything, for as long as the build
//! runs -- no host restrictions are applied, because a source may legitimately
//! live on any host. That is accepted. What it cannot do is read the key, so
//! nothing it captures outlives the build.
