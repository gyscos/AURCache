//! Canonical filesystem locations for pacman mirrorlists.
//!
//! Everything that reads or writes a mirrorlist resolves its path through here,
//! so the writers and readers cannot drift apart. They previously did: startup
//! wrote `./repo/mirrorlist` while official-repo dependency resolution read
//! `./config/pacman_x86_64/mirrorlist`, which made every package with
//! dependencies fail to add.
//!
//! These live in this crate rather than `aurcache-utils` because
//! `aurcache-db`'s dependency-backfill migration constructs an [`AurClient`],
//! so `aurcache-deps` cannot depend on `aurcache-utils` (or `aurcache-common`,
//! which depends on `aurcache-db`) without a cycle. `aurcache_utils::job_config`
//! re-exports them so the rest of the workspace has one obvious import.
//!
//! [`AurClient`]: crate::AurClient
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Mirrorlists are keyed by architecture: `<dir>/mirrorlist.<arch>`. Only
//! `x86_64` is populated today — it is the only architecture AURCache can rank
//! mirrors for — but the layout is arch-keyed from the start so adding one later
//! means writing another file rather than reworking every path.
//!
//! A single plain `<dir>/mirrorlist` is still honoured as a **convenience
//! mount**: it is adopted into the native architecture's slot at startup (see
//! `aurcache::startup`), which keeps existing deployments working and lets an
//! operator mount one file without caring about the arch suffix.
