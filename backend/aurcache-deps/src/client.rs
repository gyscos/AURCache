    ///   else means building a stand-in for it. This is also what stops a
    ///   mistaken provider from entrenching itself, as above.
    /// - **a tracked row before AURCache's own repository.** Both mean
    ///   "AURCache has it", but only a row can be linked to, and the
    ///   dependency edge is what rebuilds dependents when it changes.
    ///   Reaching the repository instead means no row exists -- a deleted
    ///   package whose artifact remains -- and `Available` is correct there,
    ///   since there is nothing to link to.
    /// - **AURCache before the AUR.** A package AURCache tracks is already
    ///   its responsibility, whether or not a build of it has succeeded yet;
    ///   sending the name to the AUR would add a second row for the same
    ///   thing.
    /// - **exact AUR name before `provides`.** Within that last source, a
    ///   package carrying the name outright is a better answer than one that
    ///   merely declares it -- see [`provider_rank`] for how the rest of that
    ///   choice is made.
    ///
    /// Cost happens to agree with the last three, which is why short-circuiting
    /// them is free rather than a compromise: the tracked column is in memory,
    /// AURCache's repository is on disk, and only the AUR columns touch the
    /// network -- the last without a bulk form, so it costs one request per
    /// name left. The first column does not fit that pattern and is asked
    /// about every name, which is the price of it deciding first.
    ///
    /// # Why `tracked` is a parameter
    ///
    /// Not merely because this crate has no database. The set of packages that
    /// can satisfy a dependency is not the set any query returns: during an
    /// add it also includes packages that add has *planned* but not yet
    /// inserted, since the whole graph is resolved before anything is written.
    /// Only the caller knows those. A version of this that fetched its own
    /// rows would still have to be handed the in-flight half, so the parameter
    /// buys correctness at no cost in coupling.

    /// was once a *separate function* callers had to remember to run first,
    /// and calling this one alone reported every package AURCache had already
    /// built as merely available.
    ///
    /// # Which columns check the version constraint
    ///
    /// Only "published". A repository hit *ends* resolution -- the binary
    /// is used as it is, and nothing downstream will ever look at its version
    /// again -- so a repository holding `foo-1.0` must not answer for
    /// `foo>=2.0`. A tracked hit defers instead: the edge it produces records
    /// the constraint, and the build queue re-checks it against each new
