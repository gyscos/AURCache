//! The lite export format: what a human authored, not what `AURCache` worked out.
//!
//! An instance's interesting state is small -- which packages you asked for,
//! how you configured them, which workers you trust. Build history, logs,
//! resolved dependency graphs and the packages themselves are large,
//! reproducible, and left out; the next resolve or build rebuilds them.
//!
//! Nothing here refers to a package by row id. Everything keys on pkgbase,
//! including settings, which the database keys by `pkg_id`. That removes the
//! id-remapping an import would otherwise need, and keeps a dump diffable and
//! mergeable by hand.
