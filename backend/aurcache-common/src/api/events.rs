//! The catalogue: every kind of structured event this build can record.
//!
//! One enum, one variant per kind, and that variant *is* the declaration --
//! there is no separate struct somewhere else and no list mapping one to the
//! other. Adding an event is adding a variant; the two `match`es below then
//! refuse to compile until it has a severity and a sentence.
//!
//! # Why an enum
//!
//! A stored row is a `kind` and a payload. Turning those back into the thing
//! they came from -- to re-render a sentence, to translate one, to check a row
//! -- is dispatch, and done by hand it is a `match kind { .. }` somebody has to
//! remember to extend. That shape has already rotted once here: the activity
//! log's `deserialize_type` silently drops a row whose kind it does not know.
//!
//! So the enum is adjacently tagged, `#[serde(tag = "kind", content = "data")]`,
//! which is exactly how a row is stored: the tag in the `kind` column, the
//! content in `data`. Assemble the two and serde dispatches on its own, with
//! nothing to keep in step. Adjacent rather than internal tagging because
//! internal tagging cannot be combined with `deny_unknown_fields`, and because
//! it is the representation the storage already has.
//!
//! A registry crate (`typetag`, `inventory`) would let variants live beside
//! their subsystems instead, at the cost of a dependency and life-before-main
//! registration. Here that advantage does not exist: the browser renders these
//! as HTML, so they have to live in this crate -- the one the wasm frontend can
//! reach -- wherever they are declared. And a registry whose entries an
//! optimiser strips in the wasm build fails by silently rendering every row as
//! its fallback sentence, which looks exactly like "that renderer is not
//! written yet".
//!
//! Lives here rather than in `aurcache-activitylog` for the same reason: that
//! crate reaches the database and can never compile to wasm. Rendering to the
//! stored columns, decoding them back, and the write queue stay there.
//!
//! See `design/structured-logs.md`.
