//! Byte-window helpers for walking a build log in bounded pages.
//!
//! The `/output` endpoint serves raw file bytes sliced by byte offset. A page
//! can start or end inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character, and each consumer —
//! the CLI's pager and the frontend's log window — has to resolve that the
//! same way. The one function that needs to be identical everywhere, so the
//! offsets both ends compute always agree, lives here.

/// Resolve a raw page of build log to a UTF-8-aligned slice, and say how far
/// the page actually advanced.
///
/// Returns `(front_skip, back_drop)`:
///
/// - `front_skip` is how many leading bytes to drop before the slice is
///   displayable — the *tail* of a character that started on the previous
///   page. A page normally starts at a boundary (the start of the log, a
///   re-aligned offset, or `log_size - cap`), so this is usually zero.
/// - `back_drop` is how many trailing bytes to drop — the *start* of a
///   character that is still being written, or that got cut by the page's
///   `limit`. The caller advances its next offset by
///   `offset + raw.len() - back_drop`, and that re-reads the character whole
///   instead of printing two mangled halves.
///
/// The slice `&raw[front_skip..raw.len() - back_drop]` does not split a
/// character at either edge. Invalid bytes anywhere else are the log's
/// problem, left for the caller's lossy decode: only a character the page cut
/// short is held back, never everything after a bad byte. The two values sum
/// to at most `raw.len()`, and to all of it when the page is nothing but a
/// split character — which is why callers also stop when
/// `raw.len() - back_drop == 0`: no forward progress, so EOF mid-character
/// terminates rather than re-reading the same tail forever.
