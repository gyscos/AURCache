//!
//! The server knows how the repository is *published* — scheme, port, path,

//! compose network, one on the LAN and a laptop running `pacman -Sy` all get
//! there by different names.
//!
//! So the split is always the same, and it is worth having in one place: take
//! everything but the host from the server, and the host from whoever is asking.
