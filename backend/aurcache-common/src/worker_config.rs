//! What a worker says it can be configured with, and what it is actually running.
//!
//! A worker *declares* its settings at registration ([`SettingDecl`]) and
//! reports what each one resolved to ([`EffectiveConfig`]). The server stores
//! both, validates the values an operator sets against the declaration, and
//! delivers them as a [`ConfigSnapshot`]; it does not know what
//! `build_memory_max` or `concurrency` *mean*, only their [`ValueKind`].
//!
//! That is the whole reason the declaration travels rather than living on the
//! server: the server and its workers are upgraded separately, and different
//! worker implementations have different settings. A server-side list would
//! need a server release before a new worker setting could be seen at all.
//!
//! See `design/implemented/worker-configuration.md`.
