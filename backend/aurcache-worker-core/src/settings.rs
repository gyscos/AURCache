//! The settings a worker declares, and how it resolves one.
//!
//! A worker's policy settings are declared here rather than read straight out
//! of the environment at the point of use, so that one table is at once:
//!
//! - what the worker tells the server it accepts ([`WorkerSettings::declare`]),
//! - what it tells the server it is actually running
//!   ([`WorkerSettings::effective`]), and
//! - where its own code reads the value from ([`WorkerSettings::size`] and the
//!   other typed readers).
//!
//! Keeping those together is the point. A `WORKER_BUILDDIR_MAX_BYTES=450G` that
//! did not parse used to mean the 200 GiB default with nothing but a line in a
//! journal to say so; here the same value is reported as rejected, beside the
//! value that stands instead, on a page an operator actually looks at.
//!
//! Each declared setting reads **two** variables, which say different things:
//! `WORKER_CONCURRENCY=4` pins the value on this machine, while
//! `WORKER_CONCURRENCY_DEFAULT=4` is a default the server may override. The
//! server's values arrive as a [`ConfigSnapshot`] and are layered between the
//! two ([`WorkerSettings::with_snapshot`]): pin, then server, then environment
//! default, then built-in default.
//!
//! What must *not* be declared is as deliberate as what is: a worker runs
//! devtools as root, so the variables that decide what a build may reach
//! (`WORKER_BIND_MOUNTS`, `WORKER_BUILD_USER`, `WORKER_MAKECHROOTPKG`) and the
//! ones needed before the server can be trusted at all (`AURCACHE_URL`, the
//! enrollment settings) are not in any spec table. See
//! `design/implemented/worker-configuration.md`.
