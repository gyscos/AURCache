//! The seam between the worker protocol and how a package actually gets built.
//!
//! [`Runner`](crate::runner::Runner) owns everything that makes a worker a
//! worker — claiming within a concurrency limit, heartbeating, self-aborting a
//! build it can no longer report, and always emitting exactly one terminal
//! report. An [`Executor`] owns only the part that differs between build
//! strategies: turning one [`JobDescriptor`] into built packages.
//!
//! There is deliberately no runtime selection here. Each executor lives in its
//! own crate with its own binary, so neither has to know the other exists and
//! retiring one is a deletion rather than a refactor.
