/// Fail a build for good and queue a *fresh* build in its place, in one

/// The one way a build is taken back from a worker: a build row is one
/// attempt, never more, so an abandoned row — silent worker, stale lease, hung
/// past the backstop, dropped by its worker, or held by a revoked one — is
/// written terminal `FAILED` and a new row is inserted for `(pkg_id,
/// platform)` while the derived retry budget allows. Nothing about the old attempt carries over:
/// the retry gets the current package version, its own log, and whatever worker
/// claims it.
///
/// ## The transaction
///
/// The terminal-status write is the decision point and everything downstream is
/// atomic with it:
///
/// 1. **CAS the row to `FAILED`**, pinned to the exact revision the caller
///    observed (`status = ACTIVE AND worker_id = ? AND lease_expires_at = ?`;
///    see [`still_held`]). The pin includes the observed
///    **lease revision**: a heartbeat renewal landing between the reaper's read
///    and its write must make this a no-op (0 rows), or a healthy worker's live
///    build would be terminally failed. `worker_id` is kept — the record of
///    who ran the attempt — and only the lease is cleared.
/// 2. **The package's status follows** ([`refresh_package_status`]): the
///    failure, or the retry queued in its place.
/// 3. **Decide the budget** by walking the package's most recent build rows
///    *on the same platform*: count the trailing consecutive `TimeoutRetry`
///    rows whose `end_reason` spends a retry ([`EndReason::spends_retry`]). Per platform because each
///    platform has its own chain of retries, and interleaving two would spend
///    one budget between them. The just-failed row is part of the walk. A `user` or
///    `auto_update` trigger, a success, or any other `end_reason` breaks the
///    chain and restores the budget.
/// 4. **Insert the retry** (`ENQUEUED`, trigger `TimeoutRetry`, version from
///    the *current* package metadata) while the count is below `max_attempts`;
///    if a pending build already exists — a concurrent auto-update queued one —
///    the insert is skipped and that build stands in for it.
///
/// If the CAS wins no row, everything rolls back and nothing downstream runs:
/// there is no "row failed but package still Building". That is the `None`: the row
/// moved on (renewed, completed, or reclaimed) between the caller's read and
/// this write.
