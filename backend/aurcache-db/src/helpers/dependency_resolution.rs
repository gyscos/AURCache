//! Dependency resolution against the packages AURCache tracks.
//!
//! This lives in `aurcache-db` because it is the lowest crate that can see
//! both the `packages` entity and the `AurClient` (via `aurcache-deps`), which
//! lets the schema migration and the runtime package pipeline share one
//! implementation.
//!
//! It is deliberately thin. Deciding *what satisfies a dependency name* is
//! `aurcache-deps`' job and is the same question whatever the source, so all
//! this does is describe the tracked packages in the shape
//! [`SatisfyIndex`] understands and hand it over. Matching, ranking and
//! ordering all happen once, in
//! [`AurClient::resolve_dependencies`](aurcache_deps::AurClient::resolve_dependencies).

/// - **An add** loads once. It resolves its whole graph before writing

///   transaction -- so the rows cannot change underneath it, and the packages
///   it intends to add travel separately as `planned`. Planning a package with
///   a hundred dependencies used to re-read the table once per package
///   planned.
/// - **A resync** loads once; it resolves a single package.
/// - **The backfill migration** must load per package: it inserts rows as it
///   recurses, so a snapshot would go stale and a package inserted earlier in
///   the run would be resolved against the AUR and added a second time.

/// Held as a named value rather than cached invisibly so that each caller's
