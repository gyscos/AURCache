//! Reading and writing the progress of a long-running operation.
//!
//! The shape both bulk add and restore need: the request that starts the work
//! returns before any of it is done, the work runs detached, and progress is
//! *recorded* rather than pushed. Recording is what makes the rest true --
//! an observer can attach late and see the run from the beginning, one that
//! disconnects misses nothing, and an error that happened while nobody was
//! watching is still there afterwards. A pushed stream would need to buffer the
//! same log behind it to manage any of that.
//!
//! Generic over the entry type. The two kinds of operation report genuinely
//! different things -- a package was added or already existed, versus a package
//! was imported or skipped or overwritten -- and flattening both into one
//! stringly outcome would lose that. Only the transport is shared: one JSON
//! object per line, read by line offset.
