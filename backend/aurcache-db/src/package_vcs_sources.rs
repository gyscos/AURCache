//! Tracks the last-seen upstream commit for each VCS (`git+...`) source entry
//! of a package, so version checks can detect upstream moves even when the
//! AUR-published `pkgver` hasn't been bumped (common for `-git`/VCS packages).
//!
//! Keyed by `(package_id, source_url)` since a single package can have
//! multiple `source` entries (including per-architecture ones), any subset of
//! which may be VCS URLs; `source_url` is the raw `.SRCINFO` source string
//! (e.g. `mypkg::git+https://example.com/repo.git#branch=develop`), which
//! already uniquely identifies each source line within a package.
