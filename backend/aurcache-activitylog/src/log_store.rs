//! Reading the structured log: filtering and paging.
//!
//! Nothing here asks whether the entities an entry names still exist. Every
//! reference links, and the page it links to decides what to do when its
//! subject is gone -- a missing package offers to add it, a missing build falls
//! back to its package's builds. Existence answered here would be stale by the
//! time anyone clicked.
//!
//! Every query here is ordinary SQL that sea-orm builds the same way for both
//! backends. That is deliberate: nothing in this repository is tested against
//! Postgres, so a query that branched by backend would be one whose *tested*
//! branch is not the branch that runs in production. It is also why the entity
//! filter reads a side table instead of reaching into the payload JSON.
//!
//! See `design/implemented/structured-logs.md`.
