//! `aurcache-cli doctor` — why is nothing building?
//!
//! The common failure of a fresh install is not a crash, it is silence: a
//! package sits in the queue and nothing happens. Diagnosing that today means
//! cross-referencing the Workers page against the Builds page and knowing what
//! to look for.
//!
//! Nearly all of the signal already exists — the server computes a
//! [`WaitingReason`] for every build no approved worker can take, and reports
//! per-worker liveness it derives from its own timeout. This module only walks
//! the chain in order and presents it.
//!
//! A failure stops the walk only where it makes what follows meaningless: an
//! unreachable server or a rejected token leaves nothing to ask. A fleet
//! problem does not, because the fleet and the queue together are what name the
//! cause — "no workers enrolled" and "no worker builds x86_64" are one finding
//! reported from both ends.
