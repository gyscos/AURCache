//! Adding many packages in one operation.
//!
//! The reason this exists rather than a loop over [`super::add::package_add`]:
//! that path resolves each AUR name to its pkgbase on its own, one RPC request
//! per package, because nothing there ever sees more than one name. Restoring a
//! thousand packages spent a thousand requests before fetching a single source.
//! `resolve_bases` already batches by URL length -- roughly 340 names per
//! request -- so the same thousand names cost three.
//!
//! Everything after that stays per-package: a checkout and a dependency plan
//! cannot be shared. Their cost falls away on its own as the run proceeds,
//! because each added package makes the next one's dependencies resolvable from
//! the database instead of the network.
