/// How a PKGBUILD is parsed: `alpm-pkgbuild-bridge`, confined by

/// The bridge parses a PKGBUILD by *sourcing* it, so every parse runs
/// attacker-supplied bash in the process that owns the package database and
/// the repository. `SourceInfoV1::from_pkgbuild` would find the bridge through
/// `PATH` and hand it this process's environment, so confinement would hinge on
/// a wrapper shadowing it there -- and a missing wrapper would parse unconfined
/// without a word. This runs both by absolute path instead: without the
/// sandbox, parsing fails rather than proceeding.
///
/// Four defences, because Landlock's filesystem policy alone closes only one of
/// them:
///
///   1. Nothing is writable but `/dev/null`. The working directory is the
///      PKGBUILD's own, readable and no more: sourcing a recipe writes nothing,
///      and anything writable would be space a PKGBUILD could fill -- the
///      server's disk, with the database and the repository on it. For a git
///      source that directory is also the checkout that is archived and sent
///      to the workers, which a writable parse could rewrite after its
///      metadata was read. The one casualty is a top-level heredoc too large
///      for a pipe, which bash spills to `$TMPDIR`; that statement fails and
///      the parse goes on.
///   2. `protected` is unreadable: the server's working directory, which holds
///      `./db`, `./repo` and `./data/ca`, and `/etc/aurcache`, which holds the
///      environment file the database password and OAuth secret come from.
///   3. The environment is replaced. Landlock cannot protect a secret already
///      in memory, and this process's environment carries `DB_PWD` and
///      `SECRET_KEY`, which a PKGBUILD reads without touching a file.
///   4. [`EXTRAS`] cuts the parse off from the processes around it, and from
///      TCP -- though not from the network as such; see there.
