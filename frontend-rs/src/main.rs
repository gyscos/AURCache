//! A Rust frontend for AURCache, in Dioxus.
//!
//! Shares the API types with the server through `aurcache-common` rather than
//! redeclaring them, so a change to a response shape becomes a compile error
//! here instead of a silent drift between two hand-maintained models.
//!
//! The port is partial. Routes that are not implemented render a "not ported"
//! card, so the gap is visible rather than hidden.

// `rsx!` turns `"{value}"` interpolation into a `format!`, and the lint reads
// that expansion as redundant. Its suggested `.to_string()` is not valid where
// a text node is expected, so every hit is a false positive from macro output.
