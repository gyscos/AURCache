//! The build fleet, and the approval that lets a machine into it.
//!
//! A worker enrolls itself and then waits: it holds no signed certificate and
//! can claim no jobs until an operator approves it. That gate is the point of
//! this screen, so a machine waiting on it is called out rather than left to be
//! spotted in a status column.
//!
//! Revoking is not a delete. It refuses the certificate, releases whatever the
//! worker had reserved and requeues its in-flight builds — and the row stays,
//! so a build from last year still resolves to the machine that produced it.
//! That is also why retired workers are hidden behind a toggle: the list only
//! grows.
