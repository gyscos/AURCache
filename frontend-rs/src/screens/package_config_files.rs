//! One package's `makepkg.conf` and `pacman.conf`.

//! A page of its own because two full-height editors do not belong on a summary
//! page, and named for what it holds rather than for a category: it was
//! "settings" while it also carried platforms, flags and removal, and those
//! read better beside the values they change, on the package page.
//!
//! Everything here is an override. The package either holds its own copy of a
//! file or inherits the server-wide one, which is why each editor says which of
//! the two is in force.
