//! Adding a package.
//!
//! A dialog over the package list rather than a page of its own: adding a
//! package is a small task, and coming back to a list that never went away is
//! less disorienting than coming back to one that reloaded. It still has a URL,
//! so it can be linked to and Back closes it.
//!
//! One step, not the three the Dart version used. Choosing a source, naming it
//! and picking architectures are not stages of anything — they are three fields,
//! and two of them usually keep their defaults.
//!
//! And one field for the source, not a pair of tabs: `looks_like_git_url` tells
//! a remote from a package name, the same way `aurcache-cli packages add` does,
//! so nobody has to say which kind of thing they are about to paste.
//!
//! Several packages can be queued before committing, all onto the same
//! platforms. Adding a handful at once is the normal case when setting a server
//! up, and the platforms are almost always the same for all of them — asking
//! once beats reopening the dialog per package and re-picking them each time.
