//! Not only what people did. The server writes an entry wherever it already
//! knows something failed -- a build that published nowhere, a worker that
//! stopped answering -- so the page you read to see what has been going on is
//! also the page that tells you something is off.
//!
//! Each entry is a typed event, rendered here from its payload so that what it
//! names links to its page; an entry this build cannot decode -- written by a
//! newer server -- shows the sentence stored with it instead.
//!
//! The one list in this app filtered *server-side*. Everything else fetches
//! its rows and filters them in the browser (see `crate::listing`); the log
//! cannot be fetched whole, because it only grows, and a filter applied to one
//! page would only ever search the page you were already looking at.
