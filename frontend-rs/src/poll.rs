//! Keeping a screen's data fresh without a manual reload.

//! `use_resource` fetches on mount and then never again on its own. The lists
//! and detail pages are things people leave open while builds run, so each one
//! calls [`use_poll`] to re-fetch on a timer: briskly while something is in
//! flight, slowly when nothing is, and not at all while the tab is hidden — a
//! build server sitting in a background tab should not emit a request a minute
//! forever.
//!
//! That timer is the coarse safety net for everything the browser cannot
//! observe directly: a build finishing, a scheduled version check, another
//! operator's change. The one case it would make wait needlessly is "I just
//! added a package" — so [`PACKAGES_REVISION`] lets the add flow announce that
//! the moment it lands, and [`use_refetch_on_package_change`] re-fetches at
//! once instead of on the next tick.
